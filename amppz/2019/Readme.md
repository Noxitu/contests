For practice timing purposes following rules were followed:
 - IDE and command line are open before timing starts,
 - .cpp file exists and contains code from previously solved task,
 - Empty .in file exists,
 - Rough problem difficulty is known beforehand (based on the solve times from actual contests),
 - Timing starts before reading the problem statement,
 - Between problems unlimited breaks are allowed.

Unfortunetelly solutions are tested only on example input, until full test cases/online judge are provided.

 # Timings #
 | Task | Solve time |
 | ---- | ---------- |
 | C    | 10min      |
 | D    | 12min      |
 | H    | 14min      |
 | A    | 10min      |
 | I    | 45min      |
