For practice timing purposes following rules were followed:
 - IDE and command line are open before timing starts,
 - .cpp file exists and contains code from previously solved task,
 - Empty .in file exists,
 - Rough problem difficulty is known beforehand (based on the solve times from actual contests),
 - Timing starts before reading the problem statement.
