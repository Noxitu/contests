# contests
This repository contains codes and utils for varius algorythmic competitions. For offline acm competitions they are often revisited solutions - created post-event and without time pressure.

# common.hpp
common.hpp file is my common header for c++11 competitions. It is used by me in amppz/, mwpz/, oi/ and pa/.

# codejamlib
codejamlib is python library/executor for solving Google Code Jam and Facebook Hacker Cup in python. It checks outputs on examples, solves test cases in parallel and "compiles" solution by inlining used external modules.
